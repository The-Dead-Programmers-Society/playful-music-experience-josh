For this assignment, I wanted to create a unique music experience, so I looked for instruments that you might not normally see together. After researching different instruments, I decided on bongos, a maraca, and a tambourine. I made them loop so you can click them once and they'll play infinitely until you click them again. For more interactivity, I added a piano with buttons.
